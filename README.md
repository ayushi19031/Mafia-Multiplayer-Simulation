# Mafia-Multiplayer-Simulation

Detailed Description given in the pdf. 

Summary: This project is an implementation of a popular Multiplayer Game Mafia. A single player can play this (User) and rest other players are simulated. There are four types of players: Mafia, Detective, Healer and Common Man.  The game will continue to run(even after the user is out of the game) until either the number of mafia players are zero or the number of mafia players in the game is equal to the number of other players in the game.
